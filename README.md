Awesome-Competency-Browser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UVU-DigitalMedia/DGM-Competency-Browser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UVU-DigitalMedia/DGM-Competency-Browser)
======================

This project allows students, faculty, and employers to see the connection between courses and specific competencies.

##Summary
ToDo: Write Summary

##Technologies Used
This project uses a modifided MEAN stack.
We have decided aginst using the express router to serve the front end for the sake of simplicity. Therfore, the project serves the front end staticly from the /app folder. However, the data API will use the new express 4 routing options to provide RESTful endpoint used for data manipulation.

###Frontend
The frontend uses Angular.js and Bootstrap.

###Backend
The back uses Node with the Express framework to serve static files, and provide back end API. The backend will also use MongoDB with Mongoose for data object modeling.

##Getting Started
Node is required.

MongoDB is required. Goto www.mongodb.org to install and find instructions to get it up and running. I recommend using homebrew to install if you are on mac.

####Install Dependancies.
Backend dependancies:

    npm install

Frontend dependancies:

    bower install

Install nodemon. If you are working on the server nodemon will restart the server when you save the files. Otherwise, nodemon isn't needed. See [Nodemon,](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for more info

    npm install -g nodemon

####Do the Database things and start the server

Start the Mongo server (sudo maybe required.)

    mongod


Start the server:
(using Nodemon)

    nodemon server.js


(or without Nodemon)

    node server.js



Then open a web browser to http://localhost:8080/ to see magic.

##GitHub Workflow

The Above workflow outlines the Git strategy for the RIA2 Class, and also works for most open source projects.

###Keeping your repos in Sync

[Here is the Github Guide to keeping your repo in sync with the main repo.](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)

Here are the basics. You will have 2 remotes set up on your local machine, one named origin and one named upstream. The upstream remmote points to the main repo and origin points to the user repo on GitHub.

Whenever you would like to get the latest code from the main branch you will do a

    $ git fetch upstream

A git pull is a shortcut command that combines a git fetch with a git merge. A git fetch operation never changes any of your own local branches under refs/heads, and is safe to do without changing your working copy. Therefore, if you would like to merge the code you got with git fetch upstream you then need to do a

    $ get merge upstream/master

Note, you can merge into a different branch than master if you would like. Just make sure whatever branch you would like the upsream master branch to merge into, that is the branch you currently have checked out on your local machine.

After you have merged the main repo code on your local machine. If you would like that on your github repo, a git push is required. Most likely you will work on code first, then push, then pull-request.

### Sycing to other forks

Additionaly, you can sync to other users forks. Just follow the the steps above to set up additional remotes that point to the other forks on github.
